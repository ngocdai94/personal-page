			<p>I'm an Electrical/Computer Engineer, and Computer Networking enthusiast.</p>

			<button onclick="moreAboutMe()" id="moreAboutMeButton" style="display: none;">More About Me</button>
			<div id="moreAboutMe" style="display: none;">
				<p>I graduated in 2018 with a B.S. in Electrical and Computer Engineering from Seattle
					University. My previous work experience has been in software development, computer
					networking, and web development.</p>

				<p>The area that fascinates me the most is the integration between hardware and software such as
					embedded devices with Internet of Things (IoT). Besides, I also love working on mobile
					development and full-stack web development.</p>

				<p>That being said, I enjoy all things related to software and technology, and I have a passion
					for learning new things.</p>

				<p>Besides programming, I like traveling, photography, reading, playing tennis, and hiking.</p>

							I had an opportunity to work with Đại as a mentor in software development. He took
							the initiative to approach me at a Microsoft sponsored outreach event in Summer 2019
							where local college students and recent graduates in the Greater Seattle area were
							attending.

							We decided to work on a series of GIS related mini-projects in support of
							Sync-n-Scale efforts to add geostamping capabilities to our GPSDO PCIe system
							interface for Microsoft Windows.

							Over the course of 18 months, while attending his college classes and dealing with
							the COVID-19 quarantine, Đại successfully developed a web-based interface with a
							MySQL backend database as a component of our testing harnesses. He was able to work
							independently and asked for direction when needed. He took user-inputs and iterated
							how the tool works.

							I enjoyed our collaboration. Given an opportunity, Đại would make a very good
							software development/test engineer.

							I had the pleasure of teaching and mentoring Dai during his time at Seattle

							as he could, often going above and beyond what is required for his courses and
							projects. He takes pride in mentoring and helping his peers. Dai will be a valuable

							I had the pleasure of studying with Dai when we were in school together. An
							incredibly gifted student, Dai was always meticulously organized. His notes were
							immaculate, and I'm not exaggerating when I say that his breadboards looked like
							works of art. Dai is dedicated, the type of person who will spend an extra hour to
							take a project from 98% perfect to 100%. He is extremely smart, focused, and driven.
							In group projects, he was the quiet backbone of the team. You can tell by talking
							with him that he has a genuine passion for software and electronics. He would make a
							great addition to any software or hardware team. Finally, I would like to add that
							Dai did not request that I write this recommendation. I just saw his profile and
							wanted to write one because he is that good.
